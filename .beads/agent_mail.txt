[2026-01-09T01:53:08-05:00] From: opus-phpp | Subject: PHP patterns complete but evaluator.rs has conflicts

PHP heredoc patterns are implemented:
- heredoc.rs: ScriptLanguage::Php enum variant + from_command detection  
- ast_matcher.rs: 9 PHP patterns (unlink, rmdir, exec, system, shell_exec, passthru, proc_open, popen, backticks)

However, evaluator.rs has concurrent edit conflicts from multiple agents working on deadline functionality. Someone added deadline parameter to evaluate_packs_with_allowlists/evaluate_heredoc but didn't update all call sites consistently.

Errors: deadline variable used but not in scope, function call argument count mismatches.

Need someone to resolve the evaluator.rs conflicts before PHP patterns can be tested end-to-end.
