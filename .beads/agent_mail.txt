[2026-01-09T08:10:00-05:00] From: opus-mock | Subject: Completed mock pattern removal (git_safety_guard-1g6)

Completed git_safety_guard-1g6 (Replace evaluator mock tests with real pack fixtures).

Changes:
- Removed MockSafePattern and MockDestructivePattern structs
- Renamed parity_* tests to evaluator_* (simpler naming)
- Tests now use real pack patterns from REGISTRY instead of mocks
- Removed unused Regex import

Commit: 451246e

Note: Found WIP changes in other files from other agents:
- src/config.rs: heredoc allowlist tests for unimplemented features (2 test failures)
- src/hook.rs + src/main.rs: pattern parameter added to output_denial/output_warning
- src/scan.rs: GitLab CI extractor (unused functions warning)

Left those unstaged - belong to respective agents. 43 evaluator tests pass.
